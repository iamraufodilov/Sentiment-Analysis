# INTRODUCTION

#In this kernel, we explore a simple implementation of the NLP technique known as sentiment analysis, 
#which attempts to quantify the tonal properties of a text dataset. This is done using the TextBlob library, 
#and is applied to the 'A Million News Headlines' dataset â€“ a corpus of over one million news article headlines published by the ABC.


# loading necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from IPython.display import display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from textblob import TextBlob

# load the dataset
my_ds_file = 'G:/rauf/STEPBYSTEP/Data/abcnews/abcnews-date-text.csv'
my_raw_ds = pd.read_csv(my_ds_file, parse_dates=[0], infer_datetime_format=True)

reindexed_data = my_raw_ds['headline_text']
reindexed_data.index = my_raw_ds['publish_date']

#_>print(my_raw_ds.head())

# to use TextBlob library
positive_sentence = "I love cheese. Truly, I feel very strongly about it: it is the best!"
neutral_sentence = "Cheese is made from milk. Yesterday, cheese was arrested. Here is some news."
negative_sentence = "Cheese is the worst! I hate it! With every fibre of my being!"

positive_blob = TextBlob(positive_sentence)
neutral_blob = TextBlob(neutral_sentence)
negative_blob = TextBlob(negative_sentence)

#_>print("Positive sentence: ", positive_blob.sentiment)
#_>print("Neutral sentence: ", neutral_blob.sentiment)
#_>print("Negative sentence: ", negative_blob.sentiment)

# now run the TextBlob sentiment function on every headline

blobs = [TextBlob(reindexed_data[i]) for i in range(reindexed_data.shape[0])]

polarity = [blob.polarity for blob in blobs]
subjectivity = [blob.subjectivity for blob in blobs]

sentiment_analysed = pd.DataFrame({'headline_text':reindexed_data, 
                                   'polarity':polarity, 
                                   'subjectivity':subjectivity},
                                  index=reindexed_data.index)

# Visualize result
monthly_averages = sentiment_analysed.resample('M').mean()
yearly_averages = sentiment_analysed.resample('A').mean()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, figsize=(18,10))

'''
This is light model for sentiment alalysis with Python.
Here TextBlob library used to analyse text.
